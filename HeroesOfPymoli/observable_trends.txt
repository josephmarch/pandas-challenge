Based on the Heroes of Pymoli data collected, we can see several observable trends. Three of interest are given below.

1) Males make up the largest gender of players who make purchases, performing over 5 times the number of purchases of Females and Other / Non-Disclosed genders combined, and accounting for over 4 times the profit.

2) People ages 35-39 who make purchases on Heroes of Pymoli appear to spend more than other age groups, but there are fewer of them making purchases than the core ages 15-34 who account for most of the profits, with ages 20-24 accounting for the most.

3) Item ID 92, Final Critic, was both the most popular and most profitable item sold, with Item ID 178, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, coming in second.
